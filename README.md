# Prosper Loan Data
## by Nahayo Gilbert


## Dataset

> Prosper is a peer-to-peer lending platform that lets borrowers access personal loans. Borrower qualifications are more accessible than many other online lenders, but rates can reach almost 36% and borrowers pay origination fees from 2.41% to 5%. Prospective borrowers can take advantage of Prosper’s prequalification tool to see what terms they’ll qualify for without impacting their credit scores.

>The data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others


## Summary of Findings

> Prosper Loan Data has 81 variables on each loan but I was only interested in 13 of them. Because Prosper Rating variable was having null values, I considered non nulls values only and compered plotted it against other variables to find out their relationships.

>In Univariate exploration, I explored the characteristics of borrowers which include the states they come from, employment status together with they monthly income. After that, I examined the characteristics of loans which includes Loan status,Term, Listing category, and loan original amount to state a few. 

>In bivariate exploration part, my goal was to understand how Prosper Rating is associated with other variables and I found out that Carifornia was having highest number of loans and moat of them was completed or paid off. I also discovered that full-time borrowers tend to get high loan because of their C rating category which means that they have estimated average annual loss rate between 6% and 9%.

>In the final multivariate exploration, I combined more than two variabeles to discover additional insights like how Borrower APR and term does not seem to affect prosper rating as much as Stated Monthly Income and Original loan Amount does; because the high Stated Monthly Income and prosper rating were in most cases associate with high loan Amount. Lastly a heat map displayed how Borrower APR and Borrower Rate have close connection.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The obvious insight is that getting a high amount loan at the lowest APR form prosper platform requires a full-time job with monthly income above 5000 and the higher prosper rating the more investors can invest in your loan.
